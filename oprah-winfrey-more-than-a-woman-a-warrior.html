        <img src="public/img/images/article2/image1.jpg" alt="image Oprah Winfrey">
        <p><a href="gallery.html"><strong>Oprah Winfrey</strong></a> was born on January 29, 1954 in Kosciusko is an actress, literary critic,
             producer and television host. Oprah has had a great media impact after the interview she did with Michael Jackson at his home in 1993.
              This interview was followed live by millions of viewers around the world. 

        

    <h3 class="main__sous-titre-article__right">AN UNEXPECTED SUCCESS</h3>
        
        <p>But nothing predestined her to this success. She had a very difficult childhood: she was raped at 9 years old and she became pregnant at 14.
            She will have the child but he will die shortly after the birth. She often had to change places to live, between her grandmother's house, her mother's house and her father's house.
            Her comfort is her studies. She is a very intelligent girl, she started to work as a journalist at the age of 17 in a small radio station, but she doesn't want to do only small radio, 
            so she moves to Chicago and succeeds in getting hired in TV to present the AM chicago show. In 1986 she became the first woman to have her own talk show called "The Oprah Winfrey Show".
            This program was the most watched program in the history of television and was on the air until 2011. Oprah is not only a presenter, she is also a business woman.
            She created her brand called O Magazine and also created her charity named Harpo which is her first name in reverse, she created other things like her production company or her cable channel. </p>

    <h3 class="main__sous-titre-article__left">HER COMMITMENT</h3>

        <p>Being a very engaged woman, she created in 2007 a charity organization to help poor girls aged 8 to 12 in Johannesburg, South Africa.
            This organization is called The Oprah Winfrey Leadership Academy for Girls. She also supports many organizations such as Women for Women International which is an organization
            for women who are war survivors and Girl Effect which is an organization that aims to end poverty among young women.</p>

    <h3 class="main__sous-titre-article__right">A SPEECH OF GREAT MAGNITUDE</h3>

        <img src="public/img/images/article2/image2.jpg" alt="Oprah Winfrey speech">

        <p> In 2018 she gave a speech at the <a href="glossary.html"><strong>Golden Globe</strong></a> that proved once again her engagement with women.
            She said in her speech I quote:
            <cite><strong>"For too long, women have not been heard or believed when they dared to speak out against the abuse of power by these men. 
            But the time has come. The time has come! [I want all the little girls watching right now to know that a new day is about to come. 
            And that when it does, it will be because of a lot of beautiful women, many of whom are in this room right now, and because of phenomenal 
            women who are fighting to become those leaders who will lead us to that moment when no one ever has to say Me Too again."</strong></cite></p>

    <h3 class="main__sous-titre-article__left">HER STRUGGLE IN POLITICS AND HER INFLUENCE</h3>   
                
        <p> "Oprah is a Democrat and was very supportive of Barack Obama in that first election.
            She was very popular politically as well. As a result, the governor of Illinois even considered giving her a seat in the <a href="glossary.html"><strong>United States Senate.</strong></a>
            Oprah has been designated as the most powerful woman in the world by the American Spectator.  
            She is also the most powerful black woman of her generation.</p>
